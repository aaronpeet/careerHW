# linkedIn Homework

## People to reach out to for recommendations:

-Anker Peet
-The Tally team (Veronica, Tim, Amanda and Holli)
-Possibly former employers if theyâ€™re on linkedIn?


## Rough draft of a custom message: 

Hello Melissa from TellueComp, I found you on linkedIn and noticed that the company you work for is based out of Orem, Utah! And I just wanted to let you know that I think Utah is pretty amazing. My family and I lived just North of there in Logan, Utah for 7 years and we have been looking to move back there as soon as I finish getting my certificate from Boise Codeworks! If you know of any entry level positions for full stack developers at TellueComp keep me and my family in mind! Thanks for your time.
