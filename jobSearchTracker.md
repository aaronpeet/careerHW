## I wasnt able to get all Ten jobs on here but I'm not finished searching and I also didn't want to just include two random ones that I wasn't interested in. Searching was hard for me. Its hard to get a full grasp on what a company is like just by reading a snippet of something they wrote trying to intice me to work for them. The most helpful thing I have done is shadow my brother Anker at his job at Healthwise, it is so much easier to get a feel for how a company treats its employees when you're there in person and get first hand experience.
